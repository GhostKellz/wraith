## 📌 Wraith 
 a modern, blazing-fast, secure reverse proxy and static site server that fully embraces modern web protocols like QUIC and HTTP/3, while offering a radically improved dev and ops experience. The goal is to reimagine NGINX — simplified, declarative, and tuned for speed and cryptographic security.

---

## 🌐 Key Protocol Stack

* **QUIC**: Native transport protocol (no TCP dependency)
* **HTTP/3**: Default supported layer
* **TLS 1.3**: Built-in, hardened, minimal config
* **DoH/DoT/DoQ**: Optional DNS layers
* **IPv6-first, IPv4 fallback**
* **Support for mTLS, OCSP Stapling, Certbot DNS validation, etc.**

---

## 🔧 Core Features

* ⚡ **Zero-downtime Hot Reloads**
* ⚙️ **Declarative Config** (YAML or TOML preferred over old NGINX DSL)
* 🧠 **Smart Routing Layer** with Host/Path/Geo/Headers
* 🔒 **Built-in Rate Limiting, DDoS Defense, WAF Support (CrowdSec/Wazuh)**
* 📦 **Edge-Ready**: Easily containerized (Zig static binary)
* 🔁 **Reverse Proxy + Load Balancer**
* 📁 **Static Site Server with compression and ETag support**
* 🛰 **Built-in ACME for TLS automation** (Wildcard + DNS challenge)
* 🔌 **Plugin/Extension system** (Think: WASI or Zig-based)

---

## 🚀 Goals

* **Zig-first** implementation, but modular to integrate into Rust environments
* Build on top of existing Zig QUIC libraries or wrap `quiche` (Cloudflare)
* Optimize for:

  * Low memory usage
  * Latency under 10ms for 99% of requests
  * Efficient connection multiplexing
* Future integration:

  * GhostMesh overlay
  * Blockchain-aware (GhostChain wallet/token reverse proxy authorization)
  * Smart firewall + network mesh compatibility

---

## 📦 CLI Design Ideas

```bash
wraith serve -c wraith.toml
wraith reload
wraith generate certs --dns
wraith status
```

---

## 🧪 Dev Notes

* Use Zig's `@import("std")` for custom allocator & TLS stack
* Consider fallback to `quiche` or `s2n-quic` for compatibility testing
* TLS certs stored in `~/.wraith/certs/` or `/etc/wraith/certs/`
* Target build size: < 2MB static binary
